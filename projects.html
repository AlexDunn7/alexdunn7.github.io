									<h3>Tech Dream Website</h3>
                                    <h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>Tech Dream is a fully functioning ecommerce business. It is developed through WordPress, with custom scripts to make the website function better using PHP. I created the social media accounts and I manage the content that is posted on there. Upon placing an order, there is an automated response that sends the information to the supplier and a notification to the email marketing system, that is set up via MailChimp. To increase the SEO score, there are also blog posts that are available on the website that were written by me. I am constantly updating the website and adding new features to help improve the business.</p>

									<h3>Java plugins</h3>
                                    <h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>I have always been a fan of the game Minecraft, I stopped playing it, but later found out that you could code custom plugins to change how the game worked. This had me hooked from the second I found out about it, which led me to create over 40 plugins. I used it to start my knowledge basis on Java which has since improved massively. I was intrigued as to whether other people would enjoy the software I created as much as I did. So, I uploaded them to Spigot and currently, they have a combined 400 downloads over 3 plugins.</p>
                                    <h4>Skills Required</h4>
                                                                      <ul>

                                       Extensive Java knowledge.</li><li>
                                       A basic understanding of computational thinking.</li><li>
                                       Coding constructs that transferred over to Java.</li><li>
                                       Problem-solving skills which was needed when the software did not function as intended.</li><li>
                                       Communication skills due to liaising with clients to discuss features.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Skills Gained</h4>

                                                                          <li>
                                       Working with a team - Due to most of my projects being assignments or individual work, this was a new scenario for me. Whilst working with a friend we had to organise the workload and coordinate ourselves to further improve the efficiency of or working.</li><li>
                                       How to deal with user feedback - This was a learning curve because I had only had my own criticism for projects I had created, but now I had users with bug reports and feature requests. This taught me how to prioritise tasks and how to keep the users happy.</li><li>
                                       Patience and attention to detail - When working with users it is essential that there are minimal bugs. However, this can be stressful as I found out. This project helped me handle both of these and learn to balance them to create a successful software product.</li>

									<h3>Working with APIs</h3>
									                                    <h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>I use coding to express my creative side. When I see a well-designed piece of software I want to explore it. APIs have allowed me to do this by creating my own spin on the original software. I started off creating Instagram bots to perform basic functions such as following people and then built up to complex programs using Python and JSON to parse through posts. Furthermore, I have used other APIs such as Discord to create bots for basic functions such as music players in voice channels.</p>

                                                                      <ul>
                                      <li>
                                       How to understand the API documentation.</li><li>
                                       Communicating with developers to understand how to use the API.</li><li>
                                       Learning how to implement the API into your code.</li><li>
                                       Designing and developing a program that will achieve the desired functions.</li><li>
                                       Using multiple programming languages in one project.</li><li>
                                       Understanding how developers update their code to ensure that the project will always be functional despite new API releases.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                       Creativity - With no limits like on an assignment, I could create whatever program I wanted. This is significant because it allowed me to discover new interests and skills which I had never had the opportunity to before.</li><li>
                                       Resourcefulness - I found through these projects that I could create projects to improve my lifestyle. Such as creating a Magic Mirror which used many APIs to function and provide me with real-time information, which I recently completed.</li>

									<h3>School / College Projects</h3>
									                                    <h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>I have taken every opportunity to pursue computing in my education as possible. I first started with ICT in year 7 and I am currently continuing my studies at college with a level 3 extended diploma in Information Technology. I have created many programs for assignments in Python, Java and HTML. As well as creating hundreds of software products for my education I have also completed the HTML Code Academy course which has helped me with website development. I am most experienced with Python, as I have spent the most time on it but, I am currently trying to expand my knowledge into other languages such as Java, JavaScript and C#.</p>

                                                                      <ul>

                                       Extensive programming knowledge (Python, C#, HTML).</li><li>
                                       Thorough knowledge of computational thinking and how I can use it to make my projects more efficient.</li><li>
                                       Working to deadlines was essential with these projects, as the time constraints were set by my tutors.</li><li>
                                       Problem-solving skills when debugging the programs, to ensure that they were efficient and included minimal bugs</li><li>
                                       Working with my peers to further expand our knowledge and improve each others software.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Skills Gained</h4>

                                                                          <li>
                                       Efficiency when coding - I started off in my education with projects that were highly inefficient and gradually I have learnt what coding techniques to use to help improve my code.</li><li>
                                       Basic computational knowledge - To understand how to code we learnt how features of PCs work, such as the CPU and how machine code functions. This was essential to kick-starting my knowledge in software development, as I now know how my code is being processed which has helped me write better software.</li>
